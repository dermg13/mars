				<p>Elon Musk and SpaceX have proposed the development of Mars transportation infrastructure in order to facilitate the eventual colonization of Mars. The mission architecture includes fully reusable launch vehicles, human-rated spacecraft, on-orbit propellant tankers, rapid-turnaround launch/landing mounts, and local production of rocket fuel on Mars via in situ resource utilization (ISRU). SpaceX's aspirational goal is to <strong>land the first humans on Mars by 2020.</strong></p>

				A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction, aerospace engineering, and scientific proposals since the 20th century. Plans include landing on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with the possibility of sending settlers and terraforming the planet and/or exploring its moons Phobos and Deimos also considered.

				The president directed NASA to land American astronauts on the Moon by 2024, and the agency is working to accelerate humanity's return to the lunar surface by all means necessary. "We've been given an ambitious and exciting goal. History has proven when we're given a task by the president, along with the resources and the tools, we can deliver," said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. "We are committed to making this happen. We have the people to achieve it. Now, we just need bipartisan support and the resources to get this done."
